# Heart Disease Prediction 
This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health data. It demonstrates how data science can help in early diagnosis and risk assessment.

Project Overview 

Objective: Build and evaluate a predictive model to identify whether a patient is at risk of heart disease.   
Tech Stack: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib.   
Models: Classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, ).   
Data: UCI Heart Disease Dataset from kaggle.

Key Steps

Data Collection: Load heart disease dataset with patient attributes (age, sex, cholesterol, etc.).             
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale features if needed.         
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize correlations and feature importance.          
Model Training: Split data into training and test sets. Train ML models to predict heart disease risk.     
 Evaluation: Evaluate model using accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and other metrics.   
 Prediction Use the trained model to predict risk for new patient data.

✨ Future Improvements:                                       
Deploy the model as a web app for public use (e.g., with Streamlit or Flask), Use advanced algorithms like XGBoost or Neural Networks for better accuracy, Perform hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
